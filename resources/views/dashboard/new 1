Some key issues discussed during the meeting included water-related projects funded (or not) by the WRC and the development, IP protection and commercialisation statuses thereof.<br> <br> The WRC identified the primary challenges to the global economy in 2018 as the water crises, the failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as large-scale, involuntary migration. The WRC has five research priorities of which one is to solve water and water-related problems that are critical to South Africa’s sustainable development and economic growth. All of these priorities are grounded in solutions.<br> <br> In carrying out its mandate, the WRC TTO recognises the importance of building partnerships with technology transfer capabilities of institutions undertaking water-related research and development. The TTO wishes, therefore, to acquaint itself with the various projects carried out by different institutions and to assist them accelerate the commercialisation of water technologies and innovations.<br> <br> VUT’S response to the WRC is that it appreciates that the current water crisis in the Western Cape might be the precursor of a tragedy across South Africa, should anything happen to the water that the whole of South Africa gets from Lesotho and Mpumalanga. Thus, VUT will endeavour to motivate early-stage research from researchers of all disciplines to use the TIA Seed Fund calls to conduct research towards water solutions.<br> <br> Selina Rapulane<br> <br> <a--}}

There they won a nine months incubation for their project. They then decided to start their own tech company called Afrinnovix.<br> <br> After seeing the GEP competition advertised on Facebook, the trio decided to apply and their application was successful. Mr Mokoena attended on behalf of the company. The event was held over two days: advice on business and pitching was offered on the first day while the second day was for the actual pitching.<br> <br> The GEP Pitching Booster invited 150 SMMES and 50 unemployed youth from Sedibeng to pitch their businesses or business ideas for a funding opportunity.<br> <br> Afrinnovix was successful and the company is thrilled.<br> <br> “We benefitted from everything we learnt through the VUT-Sasol entrepreneurship programme and we feel proud that our hard work and determination is paying off even though we still have a long way to go,” said Mr Mokoena.<br> <br> The three are determined to grow their company and offer technologies that will make life easier for society. They are using the Science Park’s Fab-Lab facilities for most of their experiments and 3D printing machines for prototypes. They are still incubated at the lab and are working on their prototype which is a backup power phone pouch – a smartphone accessory.<br> <br> GEP promotes, fosters and develops small enterprises in Gauteng thereby implementing the policy of the Gauteng Provincial Government for small enterprise development.<br> <br> Selina Rapulane<br> <br> <a--}}

The workshops form part of the Department’s activities. The workshops prepared Vaal University of Technology students and graduates on how to cope in the job market. It also equipped them with skills to search for jobs effectively.<br> <br> The workshops, which was open to all students, was designed to enable students to acquire knowledge, personal and professional skills and encourage the attitudes that will support their future development and employment.<br> <br> The aim of the workshops was to develop students and graduates’ understanding of the complexities surrounding employability. The insightful programme was facilitated by Mr. Fusi Motaung, who is an experienced training professional. A former Human Resources Management student of VUT, he is currently the training and talent consultant of Morolo Consultants.<br> <br> Mr. Motaung introduced students to a standard set of three skills for effective employability. Throughout this programme, these three skills were emphasised for students and graduates to further develop. They are as follows:<br> <br> Curriculum Vitae writing skills;<br> Job-searching skills; and<br> Interview skills.<br> These are the skills which are generally found on lists of unemployed graduates’ most desired skills.<br> <br> It has been proven that a CV is the most important tool used to communicate in the job market: “A CV is your personal billboard, it allows you to sell your potential to employers and it also shows that you are suitably qualified,” Mr Motaung said. “There are vital points one needs to take serious consideration of when drafting a CV. Keep it clear and focus on success.”<br> <br> The speaker elaborated to the attendees that they need “the elevator pitch”. You should ask yourself questions like: “Who am I? What do I do? What do I want to do?” He said that mastering one’s CV is very important and that it should be constantly updated.<br> <br> The South African labour landscape reveals that there is a 27.70% unemployment rate and a 55.90% youth unemployment rate. The problems revealed by Mr Motaung were that graduates do not have professional networks, they lack job market information as well as confidence. They do not trust themselves to speak out and promote themselves.<br> <br> In job searching, it is important to have personal contact with individuals and industry.<br> <br> “Involve yourself in one-on-one approaches, interest groups and social media. This will assist you to pull out information and to know exactly who you are dealing with, therefore you will be prepared effectively,” he said.<br> <br> Preparation is vital to perform successfully in an interview. The speaker showed the attendees how to do research, what to expect and he also took them through common competency-based questions.<br> <br> Tebello Theledi<br> <br> <a--}}
